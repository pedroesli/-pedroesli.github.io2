So I kept thinking to myself what's the best way to describe me and well why not just answer some simple questions to get peoples attention!
So whom ever is reading this and is actually looking for a talented programmer, well... read no more! You can hire me straight away!

#### What makes me happy? ![smiley-joy](/img/smiley-tears-of-joy.png)
Eating pizza and having a good time with my friends. Having the feeling of satisfaction when I get to finish a big project. Enjoying the morning sun on my skin. Watching GoT. Traveling.

#### What are my talents? ![lightbulb](/img/lightbulb.png)
If you are asking why that lightbulb is not on it's because my icon pack didn't have one. Any ways, my talents are:
- Writing complex paragraphs that only intelligent intellectuals of the high society can understand.
- Problem solving. Might take me a life time to solve it, **but** I wont  give up.
- Creativity. I enjoy trying to come up with new ideas and trying to implement them.

#### Do I utilize those talents? ![pencil](/img/pencil.png)
Yes, everyday and all the time in my life. Here's an [example](/index.html), haha yes I applied all of my talents ![lightbulb](/img/lightbulb.png) into making this wonderful website. If you asked me how I made it, credits goes to this framework: [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Pedro why not use WordPress? My response: "I don't like WordPress". Why? If you are a developer and wants to make/modify your websites template you are going to have a harder time figuring out how to make things rather than actually focusing on your site. Ok I may have shifted away from the question but now you may have discovered a new blog framework.

#### Reason to hire me in your project ![handshake](/img/handshake.png)
I will make your life easier!

#### More about me you ask? ![smiley-joy](/img/hugging.png)
I'm currently a computer science student in Universidade Católica de Brasília (ucb) and yes, you guessed it! In Brazil.
The area that I want to focus most on is software development, programmer, android dev or programmer Analyst. As a hobby I like to develop video games in my free time.
