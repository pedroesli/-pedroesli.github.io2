#### Do I utilize those talents? ![pencil](/img/aboutme/pencil.svg)
Yes, everyday and all the time in my life. Here's an [example](/index.html), haha yes I applied all of my talents into making this wonderful website. If you asked me how I made it, credits goes to this framework: [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Pedro why not use WordPress? My response: "I don't like WordPress". Why? If you are a developer and wants to make/modify your websites template you are going to have a harder time figuring out how to make things rather than actually focusing on your site. Ok I may have shifted away from the question but now you may have discovered a new blog framework.

#### What is my favourite award? ![award](/img/aboutme/award.svg)
One of my favourite accomplishment was to participate in the Swift Student Challenge - WWDC22, where I got to develop an interative app to be able to impress the judges at Apple and I got to be choosen as one of winners. Considering the challenge is world wide and only 300 people get to be choosen, I was so happy, jumping up and down out of joy, I also felt a sense of satisfaction to be have been choosen by Apple for something that was made entirely by me. You can see a video of the app that I made here: [How are Bézier curves made? A WWD22 Interactive scene](https://youtu.be/CKAgK4ZwFyQ). Or you can see the source code here: [https://github.com/pedroesli/HowAreBezierCurvesMadeStudentChallenge](https://github.com/pedroesli/HowAreBezierCurvesMadeStudentChallenge)
